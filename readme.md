# Jiak-섬 (JiakSEOM)
A food delivery platform catered specifically for South Korean cuisine.

## Description
We set out to build an online food delivery app, specifically tailored towards Korean restaurants. We were introduced to a mobile app and website called [Yellowsing](https://yellowsing.com/) which was built for Korean expatriates in Singapore, but were frustrated to discover that it did not have an in-app delivery option. We opted to solve that ourselves by building a food delivery platform with a slick interface, enabling anyone to get a taste of Korea at the click of a button!

### Why the name JiakSEOM?

It's simple, really. _"Jiak"_, in Singlish, means "to eat", while _"섬" (seom)_, in Korean, means "island".

We Singaporeans normally invite our elders, family, and friends to eat by uttering _"jiak"_ before every meal.

Hence, we thought it best to juxtapose both Singlish and Korean together by combining the term _"jiak"_ with _"섬"_, where you can find **food** on the **island** of Singapore.
